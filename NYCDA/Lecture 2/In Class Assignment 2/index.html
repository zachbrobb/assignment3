	<p>A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

	<p>According to the report, sections of the documentsâ€” "almost invariably the most crucial passages"â€”are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

	<p> CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
	</p> 

		<ul>
			<li>the Cold War</li>
			<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
			<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
