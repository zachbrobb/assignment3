	<p>Embrace adversity and make failure a regular part of your life. If you're not failing, you're probably not really moving forward.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Everything in life brings risk. It's true that you risk failure if you try something bold because you might miss it. But you also risk failure if you stand still and don't try anything new.</p>

<p>The less you venture out, the greater your risk of failure. Ironically the more you risk failure — and actually fail — the greater your chances of success.</p>

<p>If you are succeeding in everything you do, then you're probably not pushing yourself hard enough. And that means you're not taking enough risks. You risk because you have something of value you want to achieve.</p>

<p>The more you do, the more you fail. The more you fail, the more you learn. The more you learn, the better you get.</p>
